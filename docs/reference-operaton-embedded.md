title: Process Engine Adapter Operaton Embedded

# Decisions and supported features

## Spring Boot compatibility

The embedded Spring Boot starter requires Spring Boot 4, matching the Operaton 2.x Spring Boot starters. The scheduler
auto-configuration uses adapter-owned threading conditions instead of Spring Boot's removed `Threading.VIRTUAL` and
`Threading.PLATFORM` enum values.

If `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` and the application runs on Java 21 or newer, the starter contributes a
`SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler` for Spring's default `taskScheduler` bean. Otherwise, it falls back to a
`ThreadPoolTaskScheduler`.

The examples use Operaton `2.1.3`, published on Maven Central.

Embedded Spring Boot 4 applications need a working `DataSource` and transaction manager, for example via
`spring-boot-starter-jdbc` — since the Spring Boot 4 module split, the JDBC auto-configurations are not brought in
transitively by the engine starter. Applications that persist custom object variables as JSON should add
`operaton-engine-plugin-spin` and `operaton-spin-dataformat-json-jackson`; the Jackson-2 example uses those
dependencies to serialize the sample `LocalDateTime` payload.

## Jackson and Spin compatibility

The adapter starter can serialize adapter payloads with either Jackson 2 or Jackson 3, depending on what the
application provides on the classpath. For embedded Operaton, that adapter-level flexibility is narrower once Spin is
involved.

Operaton Spin's JSON integration is tied to the Jackson 2 ecosystem. Because of that:

- Embedded Operaton with Spin JSON serialization must stay on Jackson 2 for the adapter-facing serialization path.
- Embedded Operaton with Jackson 3 should not use Spin JSON serialization.
- Embedded Jackson 3 setups should avoid forcing `operaton.bpm.default-serialization-format=application/json` unless they provide a different compatible JSON variable serialization strategy.
- Embedded Jackson 3 can still work when object variables use Java serialization instead of Spin JSON serialization.

The provided examples reflect these supported combinations:

- `examples/java-operaton-embedded`: embedded example with Spin and Jackson 2
- `examples/java-operaton-embedded-jackson3`: embedded example without Spin and with Jackson 3

If an embedded application ends up with both Jackson ecosystems on the classpath, the starter prefers Jackson 3 by
default. When Spin is present, provide an explicit `AdapterDataConverter` bean backed by Jackson 2 so the adapter
matches Spin instead of relying on the default selection.

## Configuration

All embedded adapter properties use the prefix `dev.bpm-crafters.process-api.adapter.operaton-embedded`.

The adapter starter does not bring an embedded Operaton engine on its own. Add it together with an Operaton embedded setup such as `operaton-bpm-spring-boot-starter` or `operaton-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp`. With the webapp starter, log in with the admin user configured under `operaton.bpm.admin-user` (the examples use `admin` / `admin`).

### Minimal classpath

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>dev.bpm-crafters.process-engine-adapters</groupId>
    <artifactId>process-engine-adapter-operaton-embedded-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${process-engine-adapter-operaton.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.operaton.bpm.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>operaton-bpm-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.3</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Minimal YAML

```yaml
dev:
  bpm-crafters:
    process-api:
      adapter:
        operaton-embedded:
          enabled: true
          service-tasks:
            delivery-strategy: embedded_scheduled
            worker-id: embedded-worker
          user-tasks:
            delivery-strategy: embedded_scheduled
```

### Delivery strategies

#### User tasks

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `embedded_scheduled` | Polls user tasks on the configured schedule and delivers them to subscriptions. |
| `custom` | Disables the built-in recurring delivery so you can provide your own delivery mechanism. |
| `disabled` | Disables automatic user-task delivery. The embedded completion/modification APIs are still available because the engine is local. |

#### Service tasks

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `embedded_scheduled` | Uses the built-in scheduler and the local `ExternalTaskService` to fetch-and-lock external tasks. |
| `custom` | Disables the built-in recurring fetch loop so you can provide your own delivery mechanism. |
| `disabled` | Disables automatic service-task delivery. The embedded completion API is still available for tasks delivered by custom code. |

### Important properties

#### `enabled`

Turns the embedded adapter on or off. Default: `true`.

#### `service-tasks.*`

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `worker-id` | required | Worker id used for fetch-and-lock and completion calls. |
| `max-task-count` | `100` | Maximum number of external tasks fetched per pull cycle. |
| `lock-time-in-seconds` | `10` | Lock duration for fetched external tasks. |
| `retry-timeout-in-seconds` | `10` | Timeout used by the default failure retry supplier. |
| `retries` | `3` | Initial retry count used by the default failure retry supplier. |
| `delivery-strategy` | required | One of `embedded_scheduled`, `custom`, `disabled`. |
| `schedule-delivery-fixed-rate-in-seconds` | `13` | Polling interval for `embedded_scheduled`. |
| `execute-initial-pull-on-startup` | `true` | Triggers one startup pull before the recurring scheduler takes over. |

#### `user-tasks.*`

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `delivery-strategy` | required | One of `embedded_scheduled`, `custom`, `disabled`. |
| `schedule-delivery-fixed-rate-in-seconds` | `5` | Polling interval for `embedded_scheduled`. |
| `execute-initial-pull-on-startup` | `true` | Triggers one startup pull before the recurring scheduler takes over. |

### Example with explicit scheduling settings

```yaml
dev:
  bpm-crafters:
    process-api:
      adapter:
        operaton-embedded:
          enabled: true
          service-tasks:
            delivery-strategy: embedded_scheduled
            worker-id: embedded-worker
            max-task-count: 100
            lock-time-in-seconds: 10
            retry-timeout-in-seconds: 30
            retries: 3
            execute-initial-pull-on-startup: true
            schedule-delivery-fixed-rate-in-seconds: 10
          user-tasks:
            delivery-strategy: embedded_scheduled
            execute-initial-pull-on-startup: true
            schedule-delivery-fixed-rate-in-seconds: 10
```

## Message Correlation

Correlation API implementation support the following restrictions:

| Key                       | Value                  | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tenantId`                | The id of the tenant   | Correlates messages for process instances with given tenant id.                                               |
| `withoutTenantId`         | none                   | If restriction is present, correlate only with process instances without tenant id.                           |
| `useGlobalCorrelationKey` | `true` or `false`      | If set to false (default if not set), correlate using local variables, use global process variable otherwise. |


## Task Information

Currently, the Process Engine Adapter Operaton Embedded supports the following values in task information meta block, mapped from the Operaton engine:

The `TaskInformation.getMeta()` provides meta information about the task in form of a `Map<String, String>` for maximum compatibility. The Original Type column denotes
the real type, you want to access if reading the field. For this purpose, `TaskInformation` offers special access methods `getMetaValueAsOffsetDate` and `getMetaValueAsStringSet`.

## Engine Command Executor

`EngineCommandExecutor` is an embedded-adapter-specific class that controls how the four core API calls
(`correlateMessage`, `sendSignal`, `startProcess`, `deploy`) are dispatched to the embedded Operaton engine.

By default, all engine calls are submitted asynchronously to `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`. This means they run on a
**different thread** from the caller and do **not** participate in the caller's `@Transactional` context — a rollback
on the calling thread will **not** roll back the engine operation.

### Customizing execution

Provide a Spring bean of type `EngineCommandExecutor` to override the default. The
auto-configured default is annotated with `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, so your bean takes precedence automatically.

**Same-thread (synchronous) execution** — engine calls run on the calling thread and honour `@Transactional`:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun engineCommandExecutor(): EngineCommandExecutor =
  EngineCommandExecutor(Executor { it.run() })
```

**Virtual-thread execution** — lightweight concurrency without pinning platform threads:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun engineCommandExecutor(): EngineCommandExecutor =
  EngineCommandExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
```
